- Hi, I’m @aubreemarshall
- Currently a Lab for Education & Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR) teaching assistant at Michigan State University
- I am a Ph.D. student with a focus in bioarchaeology. My dissertation research will focus on ancient health and diet in the Maya region, specifically in Belize. For my research, I will analyze the micro-remains inside dental calculus (calcified tartar – the same stuff that your dental hygienist scrapes off during dental appointments!). Calculus calcifies during life, meaning things such as microbotanicals (i.e., phytoliths, pollen, starches) and proteins can become trapped in the matrix when a person interacts with foodstuff or medicine.
